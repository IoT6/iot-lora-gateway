Debian Packaging Files for the IOT LoRa Gateway

##This repo should be kept private

Directory Structure:
iotLoRaGateway - These are the files for the debian packaging files. It includes the configuration script, gateway software pre-compiled, systemd files and debian packaging files.

dev - These are all of the files that were compiled to get the final pre-compiled gateway software and ideally shouldn't be made public. These are then copied into the gateway folder for the apt package.
