#This file downloads the current software for the LoRa Gateway Packet Forwarder By Kersing and installs it on your Raspberry Pi
#At the same time it also enables SPI, Installs a service to automatically start it on boot, a configuration script and
#Sets the core clock to a fixed frequency which fixes bugs on Models 3B & 3B+

#This Software is designed to be run on a Vanilla installation of Raspbian! We cannot gaurantee that it will not break Other
#Software you are running on your Raspberry Pi.
